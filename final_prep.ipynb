    "## Introduction and Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant threat to public health, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. As global temperatures rise due to climate change, the geographic distribution of the Aedes aegypti mosquito—the primary vector for dengue—and other mosquitos like Aedes albopictus extend into new areas, increasing the risk of outbreaks in regions previously considered safe. This report examines the critical intersection of climate change and dengue fever, focusing on the countries most affected and the potential future landscape for dengue transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing historical data, I have constructed multiple supervised machine learning models to predict the number of new dengue cases by country, allowing us to gain insights into the patterns and trends of this increasingly prevalent disease. Also, I've used two unsupervised classification methods to identify the future susceptibility of various countries to dengue outbreaks, based on factors like [],[] and [].\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this study lies in the urgent need to raise awareness about the expanding risk of dengue fever as climate change intensifies. In many jurisdictions, monitoring and reporting systems are inadequate, leaving medical professionals and concerned citizens without the tools necessary to prepare for and respond to outbreaks effectively. By highlighting vulnerable regions and predicting dengue transmission trends, this report aims to provide valuable information that can support healthcare initiatives and guide policy decisions in a rapidly warming world.\n"

    "## Literature Review \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of academic sources, this project was largely inspired by this Guardian article documenting the impact of Dengue in Burkina Faso. While I had heard of it before, I had not realized the sheer geographical range of Dengue fever, sometimes also called breakbone fever because of how severe the joint pain is for many patients. While I read many sources in the process of making this, here is a condensed summary of the best academic resources I found. \n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of Dengue in the tropics goes back centuries and is well documented. The term breakbone fever was coined in the 1800s by Dr. Benjamin Rush. The earliest case in history was recorded on [] and the earliest comprehensive study I could find was [] \n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, global warming has expanded the range of multiple mosquitos that are known carriers for this disease, making more and more non-tropical countries susceptible to local epidemics of Dengue. Here is an excellent yet succinct example documenting local dengue spread in Iran. Among other things, it correctly points out that even regions that are neither southern nor tropical are at risk, because many woodlands are also prone to humidity if they are coastal enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been attempts to forecast dengue, but likely due to financial and politicial factors, they have been limited to specific countries and not to global settings. The best one I could find was this paper out of Brazil, which accomplished the task using Ensemble Methods, particularly SVMs. More research is being done in the pharmacuetical world, where ML is being used to ameliorate slow and faulty testing procedures for Dengue, like in this paper, but that is less relevant given this is a forecasting attempt. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, unsupervised methods to predict regional risk for disease are not new, as shown here and here. I could not readily find one for Dengue, so I will do my best to be among the first to go down that route. \n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating the number of present and future dengue,  I'll be using OpenDengue National Dengue Reports data, a relatively clean dataset that includes many countries and is relatively clean to begin with. But it relies on countries self-reporting Dengue cases, and many of them choose not to do so because of reasons ranging from political instability/lack of funding and internal collection, to wanting to avoid stigma. As a result there is a lot of opportunity to impute data. "

    "Notice how, because the numbers are self-reported, there can be inconsistencies. For example, American Samoa went from 479 cases in 2015, but 0 in 2016. This could be true, or it could be that there wasn't as accurate reporting in 2016.\n",

People were no longer submitting estimates."
